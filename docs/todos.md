# ideas 
  -   [ ] think about architecture - "on click submit task button : send post request, make block the button for 3s" 
  -   [✔ ] Refactor State
  -   [ ] Store tasks in backend 
  - Q [✔] Make url change without redirect
  - P [✔] Implement go to task [again, chatpgt broken it]
  - H [✔]  add a carrosel/scroll horizontally over the topics 
  - O [✔] make app responsive
  - I [✔] on click see tasks button, toggle 'see task' to 'hide task' and vice versa and hide or show tasks elements of that topic
  - J [X]  add edit on click to task box
  - K [✔]  on click task box modal for task should show up
  - M [✔] On modal mode, when click go back, go render main again
  - L [X] move add task from topics box to below search UI

# Features
  ## Components 
  - G [✔] all topics should start with hidden tasks
  - F [X] Search bar functionality
  - B [✔] Search bar UI
  - A [✔] topic should be a column with a box describing the topic and a list of tasks
    - [✔] topic box
    - [✔] for loop of tasks
      - [✔] A task is a div box 
  - [X] a floating add task button outside topic box
  - [-] **Happy with current display** a floating see tasks button outside topic box

# Refactoring
  - C [✔] **Using innerHTML is fine so far** Find a btter component creation architecture like jsx or htm hyperscript
  - D [✔] make all cdns local
  - E [X] modularize the script tag
